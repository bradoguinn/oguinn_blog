# Background

My name is **Bradley O'Guinn**. I am a doctoral student in the School of Criminal Justice at the University of Cincinnati. My research focuses on policing and the geographic concentration of crime. I enjoy using **R** and **ArcGIS** to analyze large amounts of data and identify high crime places. My recent work has been featured in _Crime and Delinquency_ and _Police Practice and Research_.
