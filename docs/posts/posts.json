Some observers claim that officers\r\nare poorly trained and unaccountable for their actions. In this study, I\r\ntest whether measures of organizational training and accountability\r\nreduce the likelihood of unarmed fatal officer-involved shootings (OIS).\r\nThe results suggest external review of deadly force may decrease the\r\nlikelihood of fatal OIS of unarmed black citizens. Other training and\r\naccountability mechanisms are unrelated to, or increase the likelihood\r\nof, fatal shootings. More research is needed to determine the causal\r\nlinks between the training and accountability mechanisms outlined in\r\nthis study and fatal police shootings.\r\nCitation\r\nO’Guinn, B.J. (2022).
